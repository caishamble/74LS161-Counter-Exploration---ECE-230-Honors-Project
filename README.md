**Abstract**: This project focuses on exploring the characteristics of the 74LS161 integrated circuit (IC) in a more specific set tailored for visual simulation. 
The exploration extends beyond theoretical analysis, incorporating practical experiments and simulations that highlight the IC’s real-world features. 
Specifically, the project delves into timing analysis and the impact of load variations on the 74LS161’s performance, which are crucial for understanding its operation in complex circuits. 
The article primarily discusses the principles of the 74LS161 IC digital logic, and relevant features, and then applies the 74LS161 to a hexadecimal counter followed by simulations. 
The simulations are divided into two types: the first using NI Multisim software to generate circuit diagrams and perform static simulations, and the second involving code in Vivado Verilog to generate dynamic waveforms
for simulation. The visual results of these two simulation methods are compared and evaluated against the actual properties and minor applications of the 74LS161 IC.

This Project initially started as _ECE230 (Digital Logic Fundamentals)_ as a course Honors Option. Now the research paper has been published on SSRN & TechRxiv.
